Welcome to the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Lab (HCAIL)!
We are a research group
in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
at the University of
Seoul.
We enjoy working on the intersection of multiple domains:
`Human-centered AI`, `Digital Health`, `Social Computing`,
and `Accessibility & Aging`.
We are pursing research in the combinations of the following directions:
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Health Informatics</li>
<li>Human-Computer Interaction</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
Our mission is
to advance AI research through design and engineering
to support individuals with special needs.
