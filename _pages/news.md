Welcome to the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Lab (HCAIL)!
We are a research group
in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
at the University of
Seoul.
We enjoy working on the intersection of multiple domains:
`human-centered AI`, `digital health`, `social computing`,
and `accessibility & aging`.

Our mission mission is
advancing AI research through design and engineering
to support individuals with special needs
across multiple domains:
health, social media, sharing economy, and education but not limited to those areas.
We are pursing research in the combinations of the following directions:
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Health Informatics</li>
<li>Human-Computer Interaction</li>
</ul>
