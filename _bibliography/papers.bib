abstract = {We propose a method of generating value scenarios for design research by leveraging ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot based on large language models. Identifying the needs of a vulnerable population, such as North Korean defectors, is challenging for researchers. To address this, we introduce ChatGPT-generated value scenarios, an extension of scenario-based design that supports critical, systemic, long-term thinking in current design practice, technology development, and deployment. Using our proposed method, we created a prompt to generate value scenarios on ChatGPT. Based on our analysis of the generated scenarios, we identified that ChatGPT could generate plausible information about Value Implications. However, it lacks details on Pervasiveness and Systemic Effects. After discussing the limitations and opportunities of ChatGPT in generating value scenarios, we conclude with suggestions for how ChatGPT might be better used to generate value scenarios.},

abstract = {The increasing performance of machine learning (ML) models necessitates greater computing resources, contributing to rising carbon intensity in ML computing and raising concerns about computational equity. Previous studies focused on developing tools that enable model developers to view the carbon intensity of the ML models in the training process. Still, little is known about how to support ML developers in online communities to explore the carbon intensity of ML models during inference. We developed MIEV, a model inference emission visualizer, that supports ML developers on TensorFlow Hub to explore the carbon intensity of image domain models during the model Inference phase. We also provide insights into designing technologies that promote collaborative work among ML developers to drive sustainable AI development processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to interactively visualize the carbon intensity of ML models in online communities during the Inference phase.},

  a lab-based usability session with eight university instructors in

abstract = {Background
Significant advancements in the field of information technology have influenced the creation of trustworthy explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the field of healthcare. Despite improved performance of XAI, XAI techniques have not yet been integrated into real-time patient care.
Objective
The aim of this systematic review is to understand the trends and gaps in research on XAI through an assessment of the essential properties of XAI and an evaluation of explanation effectiveness in the healthcare field.
Methods
A search of PubMed and Embase databases for relevant peer-reviewed articles on development of an XAI model using clinical data and evaluating explanation effectiveness published between January 1, 2011, and April 30, 2022, was conducted. All retrieved papers were screened independently by the two authors. Relevant papers were also reviewed for identification of the essential properties of XAI (e.g., stakeholders and objectives of XAI, quality of personalized explanations) and the measures of explanation effectiveness (e.g., mental model, user satisfaction, trust assessment, task performance, and correctability).
Results
Six out of 882 articles met the criteria for eligibility. AI users were the most frequently described stakeholders. XAI serves various purposes, including evaluation, justification, improvement, and learning from AI. Evaluation of the quality of personalized explanations is based on fidelity, explanatory power, interpretability, and plausibility. User satisfaction is the most frequently used measure of explanation effectiveness, followed by trust assessment, correctability, and task performance. The methods of assessing these measures also vary.
Conclusion
XAI research should address the lack of a comprehensive and agreed-upon framework for explaining XAI and standardized approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of the explanation that XAI provides to diverse AI stakeholders.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) gives many benefits to our lives. However, biased AI models created by receiving data poisoning attacks may induce social problems. Therefore, developers must consider carefully whether the training data received a poison attack when developing an AI model. Data visualization is one of the methods to facilitate the analysis of the data required for checking if the training data received a poisoning attack. However, prior studies did not visualize real-world AI training data. Restaurant reviews in delivery apps are one of the cases of a poisoned dataset. Restaurants hold review events on delivery apps to encourage customers to write a positive review in return for certain rewards, thereby creating reviews with bias. In this study, we propose POisoned Real-world Data Explainer (PORDE) that explains data poisoning attacks through visual analytics with food delivery app reviews. The findings of this study suggest implications for securing safe training data and developing less biased AI models.},

One way to analyze research trends is to collect and analyze author-defined keywords in scientific papers. Unfortunately, while author-defined keywords are beneficial to researchers aiming to figure out the trends of their research fields, 45% of scientific papers in Microsoft Academic Graph did not contain their author-defined keywords. Additionally, six of the top seven AI conferences neither collect nor disclose keywords. This paper proposes a method for generating the keywords using Galactica, a pre-trained large language model published by Meta. We evaluate this method’s performance by comparing the keywords provided by authors in the CoRL’22 and report characteristics of the generated keywords. Our study shows the F1 score of our proposed method was ten times better than that of previous studies, and 42.7% of the generated keywords are relevant to author-defined keywords.},

        However, knowledge of Korean food image classification is limited.
        The objective of this study was to train a classification model

        we collected Korean food images from the AI-Hub platform,
        a public food image dataset. The images were pre-processed and
        augmented for model training. The proposed model was evaluated
        in an experiment using a Korean food image dataset and effectively
        classified Korean food images based on transfer learning.
        The findings of the study revealed that the model’s performance in
        classifying food images depended on the type of food. The findings
        have implications for the classification model training process using

The analysis of the identified themes reveals that older adults use YouTube as a tool for collecting information that addresses their challenges when gathering information from media.

  in which they used our proposed prototype to complete predefined tasks.
  We then conducted semi-structured interviews with the participants
  to understand their acceptance and concerns about the prototype.
  The findings revealed the unique needs of art therapists and opportunities
  of using AI-assisted tools to improve online art therapy practices.
  Based on these findings, we suggest implications for creating AI-assisted
  tools that meet specific needs of art therapists in online therapy sessions,
  and further discuss future directions of research about AI-assisted tools
  for art therapists in online settings.},

abstract={Training to cope with fire disaster situations utilizing virtual reality (VR) environments as educational materials is becoming universalized. It is widely accepted that VR enables young adult trainees to undergo tactical training in potential disaster situations. However, little is known whether older adults are satisfied with using such a technique for disaster response training. To address this insufficiency, we created a VR environment in a subway fire disaster scenario and conducted an experiment, wherein 13 young and 9 older adults were asked to explore the VR environment. We then conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews involving the participants to understand their experiences. The analysis of results revealed that compared to young adults, older adults tended to move greater distances, take longer times, felt less afraid and scared, and experienced less difficulty in manipulating the controller. Subsequently, we suggest design opportunities for creating VR environments for more effective training of older adults.},
